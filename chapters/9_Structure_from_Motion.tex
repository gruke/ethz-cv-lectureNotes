\section{Structure from Motion}
\subsection{Factorization}
Factorise observations in structure of the scene and motion/calibration of the camera
Use all points in all images at the same time

\subsubsection{perspective factorization}
$$\lambda m = P M $$

\textit{something}

\subsection{structure from motion}

seriously no plan
